<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at [**University College London (UCL)**](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I am a member of the [**SOLAR Group**](https://solar.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [**Prof. He Ye**](https://heye.me/) My research interests lie in automated software engineering and agentic systems, with a particular focus on long-horizon issue resolution, program understanding, and LLM-based code agents.
My academic journey has also been enriched by collaborations with [**Prof. Sergey Mechtaev**](https://mechtaev.com/) at [**Peking University**](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

Beyond academia, I have been actively involved in technology entrepreneurship. I am a co-founder of [**EuniAI**](https://euni.ai/), [**Aimoverse**](https://aimo.network/), and Hangzhou RongzhiruanKe Ltd., where I have led the development of AI-driven products and enterprise systems.

For more details about my background, please see my [**CV**](../assets/pdf/Yue_Pan_Resume.pdf).

🌟🌟 **Excited to share: I will be in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026) in April, looking forward to meet you there!** 🤗🤗
